	--------------------------------
	1.Add  --> It is used to Add one Column values with another Column

	2.Sub  --> It is used to get the Difference b/w two values

	3.Mul  --> It is used to get the Product of two values

	4.Div  --> It is used to Divide one value with another value

	5.Modules  --> It is used to get the Remainder as an O/P

	2.Comparision Operators
	----------------------------------
	1. =		Equals to

	2. <>		Not Equals to

	3. >		Greater than

	4. <		Less than

	5. >=		Greater than or Equals to

	6. <=		Less than or Equals to
