							Functions
							--------------
	Types of Functions
	---------------------------
		1.System Defined Functions

		2.User Defined Functions

	1.System Defined Functions
	--------------------------------------
	System Defined Functions are Created / Defined by the MS Sql Server  (Default)
	It is not Possible to Modify the System Defined Functions


	2.User Defined Functions
	----------------------------------
	User Defined Functions are Created / Defined by the Users / Dev
	It is Possible to Modify the User Defined Functions

	1.System Defined Functions
	--------------------------------------
		1.Single Row Functions

		2.Column / Group / Aggregate Functions

	1.Single Row Functions
	--------------------------------
	These Functions will gives one Value as an O/P for Each and Every Row in a Table
	These Functions will Excuite based on the Rows in a Table

	1.Char / String Functions		--> Char / String Data Type Values
	2.Number Functions			--> Numerical Values
	3.Date and Time Functions	--> Date / Time Values
	4.Convertion Functions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	2.Column / Group / Aggregate Functions
	-----------------------------------------------------
	These Functions are used to get the Aggregated Data as O/P based on the Values under the Columns in a Table
	These Functions will Excuite based on the Columns in a Table

	Types of Aggregate Functions
	----------------------------------------
	1.Max()  --> It is use to get the Max under the Column in a Table

	2.Min()  --> It is used to get the Min Value under the Column in a Table

	3.Sum()  --> It is used to get the Sum of Values under the column in a Table

	4.Avg()  --> it is used to get the Avg Value under the Column in a Table

	5.Count()  --> It is used to get the Count Values under the Columns in a Table  (No.of Rows in a Table)


	Special Clauses
	--------------------
	1.Group BY
	2.Having
	3.Order BY
	4.Distinct
	5.Rollup
	6.Cube

	1.Group BY
	----------------
	It is used to get the Aggregated Data as an O/P for a Group of Similar Records under the Column
	to Work with the Group BY we need to have the "Aggregate Functions"
