Operators which may be used include AND, OR, NOT, >, >=, =, <, <=
The LIKE operator permits strings to be compared using 'wild cards'. The symbols _ and % are used to represent a single character or a sequence of characters. Note that MS Access SQL uses ? and * instead of _ and % .

There is a BETWEEN operator for checking ranges.
